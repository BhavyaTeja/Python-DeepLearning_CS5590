DEFINITION of 'Deep Learning'
An artificial intelligence function that imitates the workings of the human brain in processing data and creating patterns for use in decision making. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that has networks which are capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled. Also known as Deep Neural Learning or Deep Neural Network.

The digital era has brought about an explosion of data in all forms and from every region of the world. This data, known simply as Big Data, is gotten from sources like social media, internet search engines, e-commerce platforms, online cinemas, etc. This enormous amount of data is readily accessible and can be shared through fintech applications like cloud computing. However, the data, which normally is unstructured, is so vast that it could take decades for humans to comprehend it and extract relevant information. Companies realize the incredible potential that can result from unraveling this wealth of information, and are increasingly adapting to Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems for automated support.
